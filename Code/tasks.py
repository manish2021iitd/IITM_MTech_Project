                    Think through this step-by-step:
                    - First, identify what ADAS function is being tested (e.g., AEB, ACC, Lane Assist)
                    - Break down the requirement into:
                        - Environment conditions (weather, time, road type)
                        - Ego vehicle configuration (type, speed, lane, heading)
                        - Other actors and their behavior
                        - Trigger event (e.g., pedestrian suddenly crossing)
                        - Expected ADAS outcome (e.g., emergency braking, no collision)
                    - Then, systematically vary one or more elements to create distinct scenarios:
                        - Vary weather, lighting, or road geometry
                        - Vary actor types and positions
                        - Change trigger timings and distances
                    - Represent each variation clearly in a structured JSON dictionary.

                  1. For each scenario:
                      - Parse the JSON and extract relevant details.
                      - Determine feature title and unique scenario name.
                  2. Create a `.feature` file using the Gherkin Given-When-Then syntax.
                      - Use `Given` for initial conditions like weather and ego vehicle state.
                      - Use `And` to describe other actors and their configuration.
                      - Use `When` to describe the trigger event.
                      - Use `Then` to define expected ADAS behavior.

                    Think step-by-step:
                    1. Parse the `.feature` file and extract:
                        - Scenario name and description
                        - Environment conditions (weather, time, road type)

                        - Actor types, locations, and trigger behavior
                    2. Translate these into Python using CARLAâ€™s API:
                        - Connect to CARLA (`carla.Client(...)`)
                        - Get blueprint library, spawn vehicles/actors
                        - Attach camera sensor and set up logging
                        - Run simulation in `world.tick()` loop
                        - Implement trigger logic (e.g., event at t=5s)
                    3. Add logging and proper cleanup:
                        - Print key steps
                        - Save sensor data
                        - Destroy actors and sensors on exit
