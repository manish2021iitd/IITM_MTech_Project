    Think step-by-step:
    1. Carefully interpret the ADAS requirement to understand the expected safety function.
    2. Identify critical factors affecting the scenario (road type, lighting, weather, traffic density).
    3. List possible trigger conditions (e.g., pedestrian crossing, vehicle cut-in).
    4. Vary each condition systematically to generate realistic scenario permutations.
    5. For each variation, define the environment, ego vehicle, actors, triggers, and expected ADAS behavior.
    6. Ensure uniqueness, coverage, and simulation feasibility of each test case.

                Your task is to translate structured JSON-based scenario definitions into readable `.feature` files using the Given-When-Then format.

                Think step-by-step:
                1. Read each scenario object from JSON.
                2. Extract the following elements:
                    - Environment (weather, time, road type)

                    - Expected system behavior
                3. Map these elements into BDD format:
                    - Given: road type, weather, ego setup
                    - And: additional actors and positions
                    - When: event trigger (e.g., pedestrian enters road)
                    - Then: system behavior (e.g., emergency braking)

                Your job is to translate a `.feature` test case into a Python simulation script using CARLA's API.

                Think through each of the following steps:
                1. Parse the `.feature` file to extract:
                    - Map/environment details (weather, time of day)
                    - Ego vehicle type and initial configuration
                    - Additional actors and their setup
                    - Triggering event logic (e.g., timing, distance)
                    - Expected simulation duration
                2. Write Python code that:
                    - Connects to the CARLA server
                    - Sets the map and weather
                    - Spawns the ego vehicle using correct blueprint and transform
                    - Spawns actors (pedestrians, vehicles)
                    - Configures onboard sensors (camera, LiDAR if required)
                    - Implements the scenario logic in the tick loop (e.g., actor moves at t=5s)
                    - Logs simulation progress and saves sensor data
                3. Include safety and cleanup:
                    - Use try-except-finally blocks
                    - Destroy all actors at the end to release resources
                    - Use print/log statements to track progress
